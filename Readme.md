# Psychic Game

## What is this game?

Well, it was one of our first homeworks. Using only vanilla Js, we were supposed to create a game which takes in user input (keyboard key), and it has to match with randomly generated key. If the keys do match, user get a `win`.

## It's pretty boring

I know it's boring. Take look at the code though. dem objects and methods tho....

## Where can I play it?
